                  <p>No, Vincent doesn’t smile on any of his self-portraits. He always looks serious, and that was the look
                    he was after. Throughout art history, happy self-portraits are a rare sight and Van Gogh wasn’t about
                    to change the tradition. He didn’t paint self-portraits to practice conveying emotions, rather to experiment
                    with colours, techniques and styles of painting.</p>

                  <p>Van Gogh did indeed use a mirror to help him paint his self-portraits. Using himself as his subject meant
                    that he had a cheap and patient model. It also enabled him to experiment with different poses, expressions,
                    colours and styles, as well an endless array of ‘looks’: man with hat, man with pipe, man with hat and
                    pipe…

                  <p>Vincent didn’t own an easel in his initial years as an artist, so he pinned his painting paper to a drawing
                    board. He sometimes even worked kneeling down outside. On 20 August 1882 he wrote: ‘Because I had started
                    before the storm on my knees with a low horizon, I now had to kneel down in the mud […].’ Vincent got
                    his hands on his first portable easel in 1882, a simple model that could fit in his cramped studio and
                    was light enough to take outside. In his Self-portrait as a Painter, we do also see Vincent standing,
                    his head emerges way above the easel. When it came to drawing, Van Gogh did remain seated.</p>

                  <p>Van Gogh primarily wanted to paint figures and early in his career, he complained about how difficult it
                    was to find models, and how expensive they were. In a letter to Theo he wrote: ‘Nor is it easy to find
                    models and to get them to pose. Most painters are driven to desperation by it’. If he would have had
                    the opportunity, he would have painted more portraits. In Arles, he wrote in a letter to his brother
                    Theo: ‘There’s no better or shorter way to improve my work than to do figures. Also, I always feel confidence
                    when doing portraits, knowing that that work is much more serious — that’s perhaps not the word — but
                    rather is the thing that enables me to cultivate what’s best and most serious in me’.</p>

                  <p>Van Gogh didn’t have one particular muse. He had feelings for different women in his life, and painted
                    a few of them. The most flamboyant of these women was Agostina Segatori, the Italian owner of a cafe
                    in Paris who was in a relationship with Van Gogh for a while. He painted at least two portraits of her.

                  <p>It’s possible that works by Vincent have been lost during a marine disaster, but to be sure, we’d need
                    to know what was on board the ship before it sank. Works held in private collections a long time ago
                    can no longer be traced. Now that Van Gogh’s work is worth millions, all of its movements are meticulously
                    registered. But in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that was certainly not the case. We do know
                    that various Van Gogh works have been lost, for example during World War I and II, and in fires. Old
                    exhibition and auction catalogues as well as descriptions in Van Gogh’s letters suggest that there were
                    once more works than there are now.</p>

                  <p>If you read Vincent’s letters, he doesn’t come across as a man who had big secrets. He was generally open
                    in his correspondence with Theo, although it sometimes took him a while to report his latest news – such
                    as his relationship with Sien Hoornik in The Hague. He expressed any grievances he had, and vented how
                    he felt about what was keeping him busy. In 1877, he wrote in a letter to Theo: ‘Thanks for coming here
                    yesterday, and do let’s carry on having as few secrets as possible. We’re brothers, after all’. It would’ve
                    naturally been quite a scoop to discover that Van Gogh had fathered 16 children on the sly, but we’re
                    yet to find any such skeletons in his cupboard.</p>

                  <p>Absolutely. Van Gogh destroyed the majority of his initial work from his time in the Borinage. In order
                    to cut costs on expensive painting materials, he sometimes scraped paint from a canvas or painted over
                    the top of what was there – destroying the previous image in the process. But later in his career, Vincent’s
                    paintings would also face the chop if he wasn’t satisfied with what he had produced, as he wrote in a
                    letter: ‘I mercilessly destroyed an important canvas — a Christ with the angel in Gethsemane — as well
                    as another one depicting the poet with a starry sky — because the form hadn’t been studied from the model
                    beforehand, necessary in such cases — despite the fact that the colour was right.’</p>

                  <p>Van Gogh wanted to create art – ideally portraits – that touched people. In his own words: ‘I have a dirty
                    and difficult occupation, painting, and if I weren’t as I am I wouldn’t paint, but being as I am I often
                    work with pleasure, and I see the possibility glimmering through of making paintings in which there’s
                    some youth and freshness, although my own youth is one of those things I’ve lost. [...] But what I hope
                    to achieve is to paint a good portrait. Anyway.’ Vincent later added: ‘I’ve always had the belief that
                    through portraits one learns to reflect’.</p>
